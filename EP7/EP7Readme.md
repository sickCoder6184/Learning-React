# EP7: Learning-React  
_Repository: [sickCoder6184/Learning-React](https://github.com/sickCoder6184/Learning-React)_  

## Overview

This directory is intended as part of a hands-on, project-based React learning series. It typically contains example React code and exercises designed to deepen your understanding of React concepts by writing and experimenting with real code.

> _Note: Specific code details or the exact learning objective of EP7 are not publicly described on the repo, so the following README template covers common expectations and structure for such a directory in a React learning project._

## Structure

- **EP7/**
  - Likely includes a React project folder structure
  - May have various component files, configuration, and public assets

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the EP7 project running locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sickCoder6184/Learning-React.git
   cd Learning-React/EP7
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the React App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## What You'll Learn

Depending on the theme of EP7, you might work with one or more of the following React concepts, which are commonly covered in sequential React learning series:
- JSX and React Components
- Props and State Management
- Component Lifecycle (Class or Function Components)
- Handling Events and Forms
- Using Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect)
- Conditional Rendering or List Rendering
